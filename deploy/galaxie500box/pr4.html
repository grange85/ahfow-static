<p><font size=4><tt>Before recording their third LP, Damon and Naomi gave up on graduate school
to pursue their work with the band full time. In late 1989 and early 1990,
Galaxie played frequently in Europe, especially in the UK, garnering rave
reviews across the board. In the spring of 1990, Dean decided to move back
to New York while his bandmates stayed in Boston. They recorded their third
album, </tt><em><tt>This Is Our Music</tt></em><tt>, in the summer of 1990, again with Kramer. The
album's title was nicked from Ornette Coleman's classic for Atlantic,
recorded 30 years earlier.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size=4><tt>Although This Is Our Music would eventually become Galaxie 500's swan song,
it seems like another subtle step forward in the band's brilliant
trajectory. There are more blended vocals, Naomi's best singing on record
(a cover of Yoko Ono's &quot;Listen, the Snow Is Falling&quot;), and another set of
stunning originals. The press reaction to </tt><em><tt>This Is Our Music</tt></em><tt> was classically
adulatory. The band played the UK festival circuit, embarked on their first
full-blown American tour, and seemed on the verge of another major
evolutionary leap, when Dean announced he was leaving the band.</tt></font></p>
