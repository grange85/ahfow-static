<p align=center><font size=5><em><tt>continued...</tt></em></font></p>
<p><font size=4><tt>The Galaxie 500 story begins in New York City, where Naomi Yang, Damon
Krukowksi, and New Zealand transplant Dean Wareham attended high school
together. Graduating in 1981, Dean and Damon enrolled in college in
Cambridge, Massachusetts. During their first year there, nascent
instrumentalists Wareham (on guitar) and Krukowski (on drums) formed a band
that played the sorts of ridiculous punk covers that college students love
to play. The following year, Naomi also came to college in Cambridge and
became the band's graphics advisor. And while it was all a bit silly, the
process of musical creation ignited small fires in the brains of them all.</tt></font></p>
<p><font size=4><tt>By the end of their undergraduate careers, Dean and Damon decided to start
a &quot;real&quot; band. After an ad in the </tt><em><tt>Village Voice</tt></em><tt> failed to produce any
suitable applicants for the job of bassist, Naomi announced that she would
play bass (something she had never done previously). The trio spent the
summer of 1987 woodshedding in New York. They returned to Cambridge in the
fall of that year, named themselves after one of Ford's mid-60s muscle
cars, started playing local clubs and recorded a handful of demos. Three
songs included in the box set are from the homemade demos that Galaxie cut
that year, and even through the haze of this rudimentary production, the
infernal glow of their magic emerges. While everyone else in the States
seemed intent on mimicking either the Stooges or R.E.M., Galaxie 500
combined a thoroughly languorous attack with guitar jittery that was
unmistakably their own.</tt></font></p>
<p><font size=4><tt>In 1987, Galaxie 500 hooked up with producer Kramer to record their first
single. Although it seems unlikely that he realized it at the time,
Kramer's decision to coat the vocals on &quot;Tugboat&quot; with several feet of
reverb gave the band's sound its singular style: a soft and chewy vocal
center around which they wrapped their billowy sonic mix. Urgently simple
Moe Tucker-ish drumming, bass work that slides along your back like a
gentle 300 pound masseuse, and guitars that strum lightly or blare wildly
with disdain for external logic collided exquisitely with vocals that sound
as though they were emanating from hypnotized lips. As unwieldy as this
combination might sound on the surface, its alchemy was absolutely
addictive. (Further expanding the view of Galaxie's early sound, the box
set also features the previously unreleased &quot;I Can't Believe It's Me&quot; from
these sessions, and &quot;King of Spain,&quot; the b-side to the &quot;Tugboat&quot; single.)</tt></font></p>

<p><font size=4><tt>Hailed in Boston as a masterpiece, &quot;Tugboat&quot; set the stage for Galaxie
500's first album, </tt><em><tt>Today</tt></em><tt>, which they recorded with Kramer (for $750) in the
summer of 1988. </tt><em><tt>Melody Maker</tt></em><tt> called the LP &quot;an astonishing debut by
anybody's standards,&quot; and indeed it is. The incredible, supple beauty that
Galaxie spun like straw was so sweetly melancholic that it all but
smothered you. Damon's drums drift with the simmering presence of jazz
classicism, Naomi's bass is rich with dreamy emotional content, Dean's
guitar completes the aural landscapes begun by '69-era Sterling Morrison,
and the vocals emerge from the Ouija board of eternity. A highlight of
</tt><em><tt>Today</tt></em><tt> is the incredible primal-drone-hunch treatment the band gives to
Jonathan Richman's &quot;Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste.&quot; The three extra
tracks from this session, included on the box set, would have made Sonic
Youth's Thurston Moore fiercer in his declaration of </tt><em><tt>Today</tt></em><tt> as &quot;my favorite
guitar record of 1988.&quot;</tt></font></p>
