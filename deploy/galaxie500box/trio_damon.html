everything remained low key. We couldn&#146;t find an 
American label (our only offer was from Slash, and 
they were telling us we needed a light show), so 
just before </tt><em><tt>On Fire</tt></em><tt> came out in the U.K. we asked 
Rough Trade if they would release it in the U.S., 
too. We ended up signing a worldwide deal with 
their U.S. office, they said that for accounting 
reasons it would be easier than signing with the 
U.K. Later, the American branch of the company went 
bankrupt, and took all our records (and royalties) 
down with them... In the fall of 1991, I attended 
an auction in New York of Rough Trade U.S.&#146;s 
remaining assets, which included our contracts. 
They would have gone to the highest bidder, but we 
placed the only bid. I wrote a check and bought 
them back on our behalf. Absurd.&#148;</tt></font></p>
