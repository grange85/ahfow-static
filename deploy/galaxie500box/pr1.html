<blockquote>
<p><font size=4><tt>In 1996 the American &quot;alternative&quot; music scene is a done deal. It
has been codified and packaged and crammed down the maw of the vox
pop in every way imaginable. This was not the case ten years ago,
when &quot;making the big time&quot; consisted of flying to England for a
series of lousy, maybe-we'll-break-even club dates. It was not
then possible to imagine the golden rings that would be offered to
ostensible &quot;underground&quot; bands if only they would deign to hop on
the proper carousels. It seems incredibly naive to imagine now,
but at that time groups were forming all over the United States to
play for nothing but the sheer kick of entertaining their muses.
Undogmatic, highly personalized, often outside the scenes even in
their own hometowns, these were the peers of Boston's Galaxie 500
-- a gorgeously melodic and inventive band whose career was
finished before enough people had really made note of it.</tt></font></p>

<p align=left><font size=4><tt>Galaxie 500 are awarded their overdue hosannas with the Rykodisc release of
</tt><em><tt>Galaxie 500</tt></em><tt>, a deluxe four-CD box set, with all three
nearly-impossible-to-find albums with bonus tracks galore, videos, detailed
liner notes, and a fourth disc of rarities entitled </tt><em><tt>Uncollected Galaxie
500</tt></em><tt>. The program begins with the skeletal beauty of &quot;Tugboat,&quot; Galaxie's
first 45 release for the Aurora label, traverses through wildly dreamy
album out-takes (all of which have been remastered by New York producer
Kramer) and culminates with the box set's fourth disc. Comprised entirely
of tracks of outrageous rarity -- the Caff 45, one of the bonus tracks from
the European press of their debut album, and previously unreleased demos --
the material on this fourth disc (and even rumors of it) has driven
collectors to twitching distraction. Each of the four discs includes an
enhanced-CD track, featuring the videos the band produced with director
Sergio Huidor. Lovely new art by bassist Naomi Yang, a 48-page booklet with
essays by each of the members, unpublished photos and reproductions of
Galaxie 500 ephemera round out this lovingly-assembled tome.</tt></font></p>
