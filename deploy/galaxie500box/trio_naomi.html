must have been the night after we finished On Fire. 
I remember so dearly being in my room at my parents&#146; 
house in New York, listening to the dub of the final 
mixes while lying in bed in the dark room. All I had 
to listen to the tape on was a tinny cassette 
player, running out of batteries. The light from the 
streetlight came in the window that night, as it had 
all my life. Yet it all took on a magical quality 
for me as I listened and listened. I was so happy 
and proud of what we had done. Kramer&#146;s production 
had, as usual, taken the songs to a level I could 
never have imagined in our rehearsals - but even 
without that, all that worrying and rehearsing and 
planning and editing of the material before we even 
entered Noise had really done it. We had made 
something so real. I think I listened all night. I 
was so astonished.&#148;</tt></font></p>
